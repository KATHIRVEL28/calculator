The HTML code provided offers a straightforward yet effective calculator interface, designed to facilitate numerical calculations. Let's delve into its components and operational features:

**1. HTML Structure**:
   - The HTML document begins with the declaration `<!DOCTYPE html>`, signaling its adherence to HTML5 standards.
   - The `<html>` element encapsulates the entire document, defining its scope.
   - Within the `<head>` section, crucial metadata such as the document's title and a link to an external CSS file named "calculator.css" are specified.
   - The `<body>` section encapsulates the visible content of the calculator interface.

**2. Calculator Interface**:
   - Positioned within the `<body>`, a `<div>` element bearing the class "box" serves as a container for the calculator.
   - Nested within the "box" div, another `<div>` labeled "calculator" houses the calculator's various components.
   - Core elements of the calculator comprise an `<input>` field of type "text" with the unique identifier "os," functioning as the display screen.
   - Below the display screen, a set of buttons is provided, each representing digits (0-9), arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), and specialized functions (clear, delete).
   - Employing the `onclick` attribute, JavaScript functions are invoked to execute specific actions upon button clicks.

**3. JavaScript Functions**:
   - The JavaScript code, situated towards the file's conclusion, defines essential functions crucial for user interaction and computation.
   - Upon activation by button clicks, the `display(num)` function appends the corresponding value to the display screen, accommodating numeric input and operators.
   - Triggered upon pressing the equal button (=), the `calc()` function evaluates the expression entered in the display screen using the `eval()` function, yielding the result for display.
   - The `Clear()` function, initiated upon clicking the clear button (CL), effectively resets the display screen, clearing any existing input.
   - Activated by the delete button (Del), the `del()` function selectively removes the last character from the display screen, facilitating correction of input errors.

In summary, this HTML code furnishes a streamlined yet robust calculator interface, adept at executing fundamental arithmetic operations. Users can effortlessly input expressions via the provided buttons, with results promptly displayed on the screen. The integrated JavaScript functions seamlessly manage the calculator's operational logic, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.

# About CSS File

The following CSS code is employed to enhance the appearance of a calculator interface. Let's dissect the various style elements:

**Universal Styling (*)**:

This section ensures consistent styling across all elements:

- Margin and padding are set to 0 for all elements, ensuring a uniform layout.
- The box-sizing property is set to border-box, allowing padding and borders to be included in the total width and height of elements.
- The background color for the entire document is set to skyblue, creating a cohesive visual theme.
- All text is set to use the serif font-family, ensuring readability and a classic appearance.

**Box Container (.box)**:

This segment focuses on the container for the calculator:

- The height of the container is set to 100% of the viewport height (100vh), ensuring it fills the entire screen.
- Flexbox is utilized to center the container's children both vertically and horizontally, ensuring proper alignment regardless of screen size.

**Calculator Styling (.calculator)**:

Here, the styling for the calculator itself is defined:

- A light shade of pink (#f1eaf0) is chosen as the background color, providing a soft and inviting aesthetic.
- Padding and border-radius properties are applied to create rounded corners and a visually pleasing rectangular appearance.
- A subtle box shadow is added to provide depth and dimension to the calculator, enhancing its visual appeal.

**Input Field Styling (input)**:

This section focuses on styling the input field of the calculator:

- The input field spans all four grid columns to cover the width of the calculator, ensuring it occupies the entire space.
- Height and width properties are specified to define the size of the input field.
- Border-radius, background color, and box shadow properties are applied to style the input field, creating a visually distinct element.
- The font size is set to 50px, and text alignment is adjusted to the right, ensuring visibility and readability.
- Margins are added to position the input field within the calculator grid, maintaining proper spacing and alignment.

**Button Styling (button)**:

This segment defines the styling for the calculator buttons:

- Width and height properties are set to ensure uniform button dimensions.
- Border-radius is applied to create circular buttons, contributing to a sleek and modern design.
- Background color, font size, and border properties are adjusted to enhance the appearance of the buttons.
- A subtle box shadow effect is added to create depth and make the buttons appear interactive.

**Equal Button Styling (.equal)**:

Finally, specific styling is applied to the equal button:

- The width of the equal button is overridden to make it wider, ensuring it stands out as a key functional element.

In summary, these CSS styles work together to create an aesthetically pleasing calculator interface with a light color scheme, rounded corners, and subtle shadows. The layout is responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes for an optimal user experience.
